## Introduction

Yes, yet another Selenium Web Driver library has been brought to the table. This one, however, is slightly different. 

* Easy to understand.
* Full test coverage by unit tests and integration tests.
* Excellent support; we use this in our main project so if you find an issue - it'll likely impact us!
* Idiomatic, structured code with no gimmicks.
* Simple errors that describe what has happened and why.

## Installation

As with all Go libraries, go-selenium is easy to install. Simply run the below command:

`go get github.com/bunsenapp/go-selenium`

and then import the library in your project:

`import "github.com/bunsenapp/go-selenium"`

## Getting started

Please see the [examples/getting-started/main.go](https://github.com/bunsenapp/go-selenium/blob/master/examples/getting-started/main.go) file.

## Documentation

## Version

This project is currently in an alpha state. This means it is fairly new and hasn't been used all that much in the big wide world. Fortunately, this doesn't mean it's not stable. The project been developed in such a way that any changes will not leave you having to re-write your code.
